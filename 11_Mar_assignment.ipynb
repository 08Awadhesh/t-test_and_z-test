    "**Q1**: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",
    "use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "The t-test and the z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to compare sample data to a known population or to compare two sample populations. However, they differ in the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Test: The z-test assumes that the population standard deviation (σ) is known or can be accurately estimated from a large sample. It is suitable for cases when the sample size is large (typically n ≥ 30).\n",
    "T-Test: The t-test assumes that the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample. It is appropriate when the sample size is small (typically n < 30) or the population standard deviation is not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Test: The z-test is based on the standard normal distribution (z-distribution), which has known properties and is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Test: The t-test is based on the t-distribution (Student's t-distribution), which is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution but has fatter tails, making it more suitable for small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Test: The z-test is generally used for testing hypotheses related to population parameters, such as population mean or proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Test: The t-test is commonly used for comparing means between two samples (independent t-test) or for comparing a sample mean to a known value (one-sample t-test).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Test:\n",
    "Suppose a company claims that their product's average weight is 500 grams. To test this claim, you take a large random sample of 100 products and find that the sample mean weight is 498 grams, with a known population standard deviation of 10 grams. In this scenario, you can use a z-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the claimed population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Test:\n",
    "Imagine a researcher wants to investigate if there is a significant difference in exam scores between two groups of students, Group A (n = 25) and Group B (n = 22). Since the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample sizes are relatively small, the researcher should use a two-sample independent t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",

    "A one-tailed test (also known as a one-sided test) is a type of statistical hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis (H0) is tested against an alternative hypothesis (Ha) in only one direction. The direction of interest is specified before conducting the test, and the test is designed to determine if the sample data significantly deviates from the null hypothesis in that specific direction. The critical region for the test is located entirely in one tail of the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of one-tailed tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right-Tailed Test (Upper-Tailed Test)**: The critical region is located in the right tail of the probability distribution. This test is used to determine if the sample data is significantly greater than a specified value or population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Left-Tailed Test (Lower-Tailed Test)**: The critical region is located in the left tail of the probability distribution. This test is used to determine if the sample data is significantly less than a specified value or population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-Tailed Test:**\n",
    "A two-tailed test (also known as a two-sided test) is another type of statistical hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis (H0) is tested against an alternative hypothesis (Ha) in both directions. The test aims to determine if the sample data significantly deviates from the null hypothesis in either direction, whether it is greater or less than the null hypothesis value. The critical region for the test is split between both tails of the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-tailed test is used when the direction of the effect is not specified or when researchers want to be sensitive to differences in both directions. It is commonly used to test if there is a significant difference between two groups or if a sample parameter significantly differs from a hypothesized population parameter."

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "The margin of error (MOE) in a confidence interval is a measure of the precision or uncertainty around the estimated population parameter (e.g., population mean or proportion). It represents the range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to lie with a certain level of confidence. A smaller margin of error indicates higher precision and a more accurate estimation of the population parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "How Sample Size Affects the Margin of Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size (n) has an inverse relationship with the margin of error (MOE). As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, and vice versa. In other words, larger sample sizes lead to smaller margins of error, while smaller sample sizes result in larger margins of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sample size is large, the standard error (σ / √n or √((p * (1 - p)) / n)) becomes smaller, which indicates that the sample mean (or proportion) is likely to be more representative of the true population mean (or proportion). Consequently, the range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to lie becomes narrower, leading to a smaller margin of error.\n",
